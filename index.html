        <p>
          In recent years, the research community has made significant strides in generative 
          models, particularly in the area of video generation. Despite challenges in generating 
          temporally coherent and physically realistic videos, recent breakthroughs such as SORA, Kling, 
          Genie, and MovieGen show promising progress toward controllable, high-fidelity visual 
          world models. This tutorial offers a deep dive into recent advances in text-to-video 
          generation, diffusion-based video models, and the bridge from generative video to 
          physical and interactive world modeling. We aim to provide attendees with a comprehensive
          understanding of these cutting-edge methods and how they contribute to building 
          embodied world models.

                <p class="abstract">Simulation offers tremendous promise for training and evaluating agents in diverse controllable settings, yet, we remain far from building a simulator that is anywhere near as rich as the real world. But what if we could learn one? With the advent of foundation world models we are now entering a new era, where we can train world models from vast quantities of passively acquired data such as internet videos. These foundation world models can then generate unlimited environments for agents, offering the path to open-ended curricula. This talk outlines progress in this space over the past two years, while looking ahead to the future.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Video generation models, by learning to synthesize pixels from large-scale real-world data, have shown great promise as world models. Yet, pixel-only approaches face critical challenges: they struggle with precise action control, cannot guarantee physical consistency, and suffer from computational inefficiency—fundamentally limiting how users and agents can interact with these virtual worlds. At the heart of these limitations lies a crucial missing piece: explicit physical grounding. In this talk, I will present how we address this gap through physics-grounded world models: WonderWorld enables fast, interactive world generation and real-time exploration by introducing a physics-based representation, and WonderPlay extends this to dynamic action control by integrating physics simulation with video generation. Finally, I will introduce WorldScore, a unified benchmark that evaluates world models—spanning 3D, 4D, and video generation—on their ability to generate controllable, consistent, and dynamic worlds. These works outline a path towards interactive world models by synergizing neural pixel generation and physical understanding.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</p>

Recent video models are reaching an uncanny level of visual realism. They certainly look like they understand the world. They’re getting remarkably good at rendering (!). But how do we make that understanding more concrete, more structured—something we can reason with and act on? I’ll suggest that getting there might require streaming perception: systems that build structured, persistent internal representations from continuous input. I’ll share recent works like CUT3R and ST4rtrack as steps in this direction, and offer a perspective shaped by my recent experience raising a small human.</p>
